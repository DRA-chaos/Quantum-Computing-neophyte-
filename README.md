# Quantum-Computing-neophyte-
This repository is a culmination of a few Jupyter notebooks where I have tried exploring Qiskit in various capacities.

The 'Finding marked element using Grover's algorithm' makes use of the Grover's algorithm to make a quantum program that first constructs a 6 qubit circuit, then determines 'r' or the number of optimal rounds given by the formula :

Finally we measure the qubits ( we can't do that in between otherwise the wavefunction as we know collapses)
